## Experiments on Average-Case Accelerated First-Order Polynomial-Based Methods

This repository is a collection of experiments for my Junior Paper at Princeton in Spring 2023. I conducted ablation studies on the average case optimization methods proposed by Pedregosa and Schieur, comparing the novel polynomial-based algorithms with classical optimizers such as Adagrad and Adam, on both real and synthetic datasets.
